# Resume Classification and Job Recommendation System
The system is designed to classify resumes into predefined professional categories. Additionally, it recommends the most relevant job roles by computing the similarity between a candidateâ€™s resume and available job descriptions.

* Extracted raw text content from resume PDFs using the `pdfplumber` library.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the resume dataset by removing duplicates, stopwords, hyperlinks, and unwanted symbols.
* Engineered domain-specific features from resumes such as skills, education, experience.
* Built and evaluated a multi-class classification model using a Random Forest classifier with a One-vs-Rest strategy on TF-IDF vectorized text data.
* Computed cosine similarity between processed resume text and job descriptions to recommend the top job matches for a given resume.
* Compared model performance using raw resume text versus extracted structured features to analyze the trade-offs in classification accuracy.
